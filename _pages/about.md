# Biography
I have graduated and received my Bachelor degree from [School of Mathematical Science](http://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) of [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2019. I am now pursuing my Ph.D degree under the supervision Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/#) at [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

# Research Interests
My research interests include topics in machine learning and computer vision.
Most recently, I am interested in Explainable deep learning.
